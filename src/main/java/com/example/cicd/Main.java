    //HOW CI/CD WORKS
    //CI/CD is an automated process that involves frequent code integration, automated testing, and continuous deployment of software changes to production.

    //The four steps of a CI/CD pipeline work together to ensure that software changes are tested, integrated, and deployed to production automatically.
    //This automation helps to reduce errors, increase efficiency, and improve the overall quality of the software.

    //By adopting a CI/CD pipeline, development teams can achieve faster release cycles, reduce the risk of software defects, and improve the user experience.

    //Keep in mind that the pipeline stages might look different given the specific project or company we're talking about.
    //Meaning, some teams might or might not use automated testing, some teams might or might not have a "staging" environment, and so on.

    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //                                  LET'S EXPLAIN EACH STEP IN A LITTLE MORE DETAIL:

    //1- CODE INTEGRATION
    //The first step in the CI/CD pipeline is code integration.
    //In this step, developers commit their code changes to a remote repository (like GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket), where the code is integrated with the main codebase.
    //This step aims to ensure that the code changes are compatible with the rest of the codebase and do not break the build.

    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //2 - AUTOMATED TESTING
    //Once the code is integrated, the next step is automated testing.
    //Automated testing involves running a suite of tests to ensure that the code changes are functional, meet the expected quality standards, and are free of defects.
    //This step helps identify issues early in the development process, allowing developers to fix them quickly and efficiently.

    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //3-CONTINUES DEPLOYMENT
    //After the code changes pass the automated testing step, the next step is continuous deployment.
    //In this step, the code changes are automatically deployed to a staging environment for further testing.
    //This step aims to ensure that the software is continuously updated with the latest code changes, delivering new features and functionality to users quickly and efficiently.

    //4-PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
    //The final step in the CI/CD pipeline is production deployment.
    //In this step, the software changes are released to end-users.
    //This step involves monitoring the production environment, ensuring that the software is running smoothly, and identifying and fixing any issues that arise.

    //                            THE KEY BENEFITS OF CI/CD

    //THE KEY BENEFITS OF CI/CD INCLUDES `

    //1- FASTER RELEASE CYCLES
    //By automating the testing and deployment process, CI/CD enables teams to release software more frequently, responding quickly to customer needs.

    //2- IMPROVED QUALITY
    //Automated testing ensures that software changes do not introduce new bugs or issues, improving the overall quality of the software.

    //3- INCREASED COLLABORATION
    //Frequent code integration and testing require developers to work closely together, leading to better collaboration and communication.

    //4- REDUCED RISK
    // Continuous deployment allows developers to identify and fix issues quickly, reducing the risk of major failures

    //5- COST-EFFECTIVE
    //CI/CD reduces the amount of manual work required to deploy software changes, saving time and reducing costs.
