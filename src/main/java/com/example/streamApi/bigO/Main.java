    //BIG O NATION
    //Big O is necessary to describe complexity of the algorithm

    // O - It is algorithm
    // (n) - This is the quantity of actions performed

    //*************************************************************

    //O (1) - It means that independent of quantity of element ,  the action is performed in constant time
    //arraylist.get(3) = The complexity is O(1)

    //*************************************************************

    //0 (n) - It means that actions will be performed in n times
    //arrayList.contains("a")

    //BEST CASE Big O (1) = If the "a" is at the first index of the array.

    //AVERAGE CASE Big O (n/2) = If the "a" is in the middle of array.

    //WORST CASE Big O (n) = if the "a" is at the end of array.

    //*************************************************************

    //O (log n) - This algorithm is in the middle of O(1) and O(n)
    //Binary searching
