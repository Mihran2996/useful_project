    //Open Source Identity and Access Management

    //Add authentication to applications and secure services with minimum effort.
    //No need to deal with storing users or authenticating users.
    //Keycloak strong authentication, user management, fine-grained authorization, and more.

    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //Single-Sign On

    //Users authenticate with Keycloak rather than individual applications.
    //This means that your applications don't have to deal with login forms,authenticating users, and storing users.
    //Once logged-in to Keycloak, users don't have to login again to access a different application.

    //This also applies to logout. Keycloak provides single-sign out,
    //which means users only have to logout once to be logged-out of all applications that use Keycloak.
    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //Identity Brokering and Social Login

    //Enabling login with social networks is easy to add through the admin console.
    //It's just a matter of selecting the social network you want to add. No code or changes to your application is required.
    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //User Federation

    //Keycloak has built-in support to connect to existing LDAP or Active Directory servers.
    //You can also implement your own provider if you have users in other stores, such as a relational database.
    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //Admin Console

    //Through the admin console administrators can centrally manage all aspects of the Keycloak server.
    //They can enable and disable various features. They can configure identity brokering and user federation.
    //They can create and manage applications and services, and define fine-grained authorization policies.
    //hey can also manage users, including permissions and sessions
    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //Account Management Console

    //Through the account management console users can manage their own accounts.
    //They can update the profile, change passwords, and setup two-factor authentication
    //Users can also manage sessions as well as view history for the account.
    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //Standard Protocols

    //Keycloak is based on standard protocols and provides support for OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.
    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //Authorization Services

    //If role based authorization doesn't coresspo your needs, Keycloak provides fine-grained authorization services as well.
    //This allows you to manage permissions for all your services from the Keycloak admin console
    //and gives you the power to define exactly the policies you need.
