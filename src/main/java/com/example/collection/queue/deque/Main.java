    //DEQUE INTERFACE

    //******************************************************************************************************************
    //Deque interface present in java.util package is a subtype of the queue interface.
    //The Deque is related to the double-ended queue that supports the addition or removal of elements
    //from either end of the data structure. It can either be used as a queue(first-in-first-out/FIFO)
    //or as a stack(last-in-first-out/LIFO).

    //The Deque (double-ended queue) interface in Java is a subinterface of the Queue interface
    //and extends it to provide a double-ended queue, which is a queue that allows elements to be added and removed
    //from both ends. The Deque interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to provide a generic
    //and flexible data structure that can be used to implement a variety of algorithms and data
    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //LinkedList and ArrayDeque are classes which implement the Deque interface

    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //ADVANTAGES OF DEQUE

    //DOUBLE-ENDED:
    //The main advantage of the Deque interface is that it provides a double-ended queue,
    //which allows elements to be added and removed from both ends of the queue.
    //This makes it a good choice for scenarios where you need to insert or remove elements at both the front and end of the queue.

    //******************************************************************************************************************

    //DISADVANTAGES OF DEQUE

    //PERFORMANCE:
    //The performance of a Deque can be slower than other data structures,
    //such as a linked list or an array, because it provides more functionality.
