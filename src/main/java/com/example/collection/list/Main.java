    //LIST INTERFACE

    //The Lists interface in Java provides a way to store the ordered collection. It is a child interface of Collection.
    //It is an ordered collection of objects in which duplicate values can be stored.
    //The List interface is found in java.util package and inherits the Collection interface.
    //It is a factory of the ListIterator interface.
    //Through the ListIterator, we can iterate the list in forward and backward directions.
    //The implementation classes of the List interface are ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, and Vector.


    //The List is an ordered sequence.
    //List allows duplicate elements
    //Default size is 10
    //Elements by their position can be accessed.
    //Multiple null elements can be stored.
}
