    //What is the difference between Collection and Collections?

    //Collection (Interface): This is a root-level interface of the Java Collections Framework (JCF).
    //It represents a group of objects, known as elements.
    //Collection provides general-purpose methods that all collections share, such as adding, removing, and checking elements.

    //Collections (Class): This is a utility class that consists of static methods that operate on or return collections.
    //It contains methods for algorithms like sorting, searching, and manipulating collections.
